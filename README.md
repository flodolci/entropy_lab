# entropy_lab

Modern learning algorithms, inference methods, and communication systems all revolve around the same core idea: Information flows through noisy systems.

```entropy_lab``` is a Python laboratory for _experimenting_ with these ideas. 
Instead of treating entropy, mutual information, and learning as abstract formulas, the project studies them through simple stochastic systems that can be simulated, observed, inferred, and learned from.
