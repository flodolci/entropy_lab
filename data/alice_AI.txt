Mira and the Clockwork Garden

Mira had not meant to follow the pebble.

It was, to begin with, a very ordinary pebble, no larger than the nail of her thumb, pale gray with a white stripe running around its middle like a belt. She had found it at the edge of the lane while walking home, and because the afternoon was long and the hedges were full of sleepy bees, she had kicked it once with the toe of her shoe.

It skipped ahead with a neat little tap.

She kicked it again.

Tap.

Again.

Tap-tap.

Now, pebbles are not generally companions, and still less are they leaders; but this one behaved in a way that made Mira suspicious almost at once. Whenever she aimed to send it left, it went right. Whenever she tried to lose it in the grass, it reappeared in the middle of the path. Once she kicked it directly into a puddle, and it came out on the dry side without so much as a glisten, as if the water had thought better of wetting it.

“That is peculiar,” said Mira aloud, for she was fond of announcing facts when nobody was there to hear them. “And I should know, because I am very good at peculiar.”

The pebble did not answer, but it rolled forward of its own accord.

Mira stopped walking.

The pebble rolled two inches more, stopped also, and seemed to wait.

Now if there is one thing more irresistible than a secret, it is a secret that pauses to make sure you are following. Mira put her hands behind her back (which she believed made her look like a detective) and marched after it, not hurrying at all, though she did glance down every few steps to make certain it had not escaped.

The lane bent toward the old field behind the blacksmith’s cottage, where a wall of ivy-covered stone stood so long and so still that even the crows forgot to caw near it. Mira had passed that wall a hundred times. There was no gate in it, no break in it, no anything in it except ivy, stone, and one cracked corner where a snail lived in summer.

The pebble rolled directly to that cracked corner and disappeared.

“Into the snail’s house?” said Mira, scandalized. “That is trespassing, and on a very small scale.”

She crouched and parted the ivy.

Behind it was not a crack at all, but a round door painted the green of bottle glass. It had no knob. In the middle was a brass plate engraved with a picture of a key, and under it, in tiny letters:

KNOCK WITH A QUESTION

Mira sat back on her heels.

“What a rude door,” she said. “As if a plain knock were not good enough.”

She considered for a moment, because one ought to choose a question carefully if it is to be used as a knocker. At last she tapped the brass plate with one finger and said, “What is on the other side?”

The door opened at once.

Not a crack, not a creak, but a whole wide opening in one smooth motion, as if the wall had simply remembered it was meant to be a doorway. Cool air spilled out, smelling of mint and rain and something bright, like pennies rubbed warm in your palm.

Mira peered in.

There was a staircase, spiraling down and down, lined with lamps shaped like glass pears. In each pear-lamp floated a tiny flame, and each flame had a little black eye in its middle. As Mira watched, the nearest flame blinked at her.

“You may come,” it said in a voice like a match being struck.

Mira nearly fell backward. “Did you speak?”

“Only because you are listening,” said the flame. “People are forever coming to doors and never listening. They miss half the house.”

Mira stood up, smoothed her skirt, and did what she usually did when faced with impossible things: she behaved as if they had been expected all along.

“Very well,” she said. “If I come down, can I come back up?”

The flame squinted thoughtfully. “That depends whether you leave the same way you arrived.”

“That is not an answer.”

“It is the answer we have,” said the flame, and yawned a thread of smoke.

Mira looked up the lane. The afternoon was still there, and the hedges, and the bees, and everything so completely ordinary that it seemed almost suspicious. She looked down the stair again. The pear-lamps went in a shining coil, farther than sight.

She took a breath.

Then another.

“People will worry if I am late for supper,” she said.

“Then be early,” replied the flame.

And that was so unhelpful that Mira felt suddenly bold. She stepped through the green door and began to descend.

The stairs were shallow and easy, though they made her feel as if she were walking inside a shell. With every turn the air grew cooler, and the lamps watched her pass, some blinking, some winking, some pretending not to look at all, which was the rudest kind of looking. After what might have been ten minutes or a whole Thursday, the staircase ended in a hall paved with black-and-white tiles arranged not in squares but in spirals.

At the far end stood a signpost.

Mira went to read it.

It had four arms pointing in four directions, though there were only three corridors.

The first arm said:

THIS WAY TO THE CLOCKWORK GARDEN

The second:

THAT WAY TO THE CLOCKWORK GARDEN

The third:

THE OTHER WAY TO THE CLOCKWORK GARDEN

The fourth, which pointed directly into the wall, said:

IF YOU ARE CERTAIN, DO NOT GO THIS WAY

Mira turned slowly in a circle. “This is a very confusing place.”

“Thank you,” said the signpost, sounding pleased.

Mira stared. “Did you speak too?”

“Of course. Do you suppose I stand here all day for decoration?”

“I don’t know what signposts do when I’m not looking.”

“Mostly we point,” said the signpost. “And occasionally we advise. It is a neglected art.”

Mira folded her arms. “Which way is the real way to the garden?”

“All of them.”

“That is impossible.”

“It is merely inconvenient,” said the signpost. “The way changes according to what you bring.”

Mira looked down at herself. “I have nothing but a handkerchief, a biscuit, and a piece of string.”

“Then take the middle corridor,” said the signpost without hesitation.

She did. The corridor was lined with wallpaper patterned in tiny clocks, each ticking at a different speed. One went so fast it sounded like rain. Another ticked only once every ten steps. A third appeared to be thinking about it.

As she walked, the floor became soft underfoot, and the wallpaper gave way to hedges. The corridor opened at last into a garden unlike any she had seen.

Everywhere were flowers made of metal and glass. Tulips of copper opened and shut with a gentle clicking. Roses of silver unfurled petals thin as spoons. Vines of linked brass leaves crawled up trellises and shivered in time with a soundless music. Little birds, no larger than walnuts, flitted from branch to branch, their wings ticking like pocket watches.

In the center of the garden stood a fountain. Instead of water it poured white sand, smooth as silk, which fell into a basin and vanished before it overflowed.

Mira forgot herself and clapped her hands.

A nearby daisy turned its golden screw-head toward her. “Don’t do that!”

“Do what?”

“Make sudden sounds. You’ll startle the Minutes.”

“The what?”

At once the sand-fountain hiccupped. Out from behind the basin came a troop of tiny figures in blue coats and pointed hats, each carrying a silver rake. They were no higher than Mira’s knee and had faces wrinkled like dried apples. They peered at her with matching disapproval.

“A loud child,” said one.

“Very loud,” said another.

“Catastrophically loud,” said a third, though Mira thought this was an exaggeration.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “I didn’t know there were Minutes.”

“There are always Minutes,” said the first, tapping his rake. “The trouble is people spend them.”

The others murmured agreement and began raking around her shoes, collecting something invisible.

Mira bent down. “What are you doing?”

“Tidying your noise,” said a Minute. “If left loose, it gets into the gears.”

“Whose gears?”

All the Minutes pointed, with perfect solemnity, to the far side of the garden.

There, partly hidden behind a hedge trimmed in spirals, stood a house shaped like a clock. Its round face was the front wall; its windows sat where numerals ought to be; and its chimney rose from the top like an exclamation mark. The hands were moving, but not evenly. They jerked forward, shuddered, stopped, then leapt again.

At the clock-house door stood a person in a coat made entirely of pockets.

He was tall and thin and folded in the middle as if he had been put away carelessly. A pair of spectacles perched on his forehead, another on his nose, and a third hung from one ear for emergencies. His hair stuck out behind him in points, like the rays of a sun drawn by an impatient child.

The daisy whispered, “That’s the Keeper.”

The Keeper cupped one hand behind his ear and called, “Who is trampling my Tuesday?”

Mira stepped forward. “I’m sorry if I’ve trampled it. I didn’t mean to. I’m Mira.”

The Keeper marched up to her, peering from one set of spectacles, then another, then the emergency pair. “Mira, Mira... no, we’ve not had a Mira in years. Last one arrived with a parrot and left with a thunderstorm. Untidy business. Have you brought tools?”

“No.”

“Excellent. People with tools always use them.” He looked around sharply. “Minutes! Have you swept her surprise?”

“We’re raking it now,” chorused the Minutes.

“Good. Keep it from the cogs.”

Mira pointed at the clock-house. “What happened to it?”

The Keeper’s face folded into several new worries at once. “What happened? What happened? Everything happened. The best and worst kind of catastrophe. A delay.”

“Isn’t that just being late?”

He gasped. Even the mechanical flowers seemed to lean in.

“My dear child,” he said, lowering his voice, “being late is a personal failing. A Delay is a creature.”

Mira took one step back. “A creature?”

“A sly one. Long, gray, soft-footed. Slips under doors. Sits on plans. Drinks momentum. Leaves crumbs in the future. It has nested in the Main Spring.”

“Can’t you chase it out?”

“I have tried clocks, bells, schedules, whistles, stern letters, and a remarkably pointed umbrella.” He patted one of his many pockets. “Nothing works. The garden is running slower every hour. Soon the tulips will close forever, the birds will wind down, and the Minutes—”

“We shall become Moments,” said the nearest Minute darkly.

“—which is a demotion,” the Keeper finished. “Intolerable.”

Mira looked at the jerking clock hands, the worried flowers, the little men raking her noise into neat invisible piles.

“Can I help?” she asked.

The Keeper brightened and frowned at once, like a lamp with an opinion. “Possibly. Unqualified assistance is often exactly what’s needed. Come along!”

He seized her hand—not unkindly, but with the urgency of someone trying to catch up to himself—and pulled her toward the clock-house.

Inside, the air was warm and smelled of tea, oil, and old books. The walls were lined with shelves full of clocks: tall ones, round ones, square ones, clocks with moons, clocks with birds, clocks with no numbers, clocks with too many numbers, and one very tiny clock wearing what looked like a knitted sock.

In the center of the room stood a great brass mechanism taller than Mira, all gears and chains and polished wheels. It trembled and clicked and gave a little sigh every few seconds. At its base was a narrow opening, like a cat-flap, from which came a faint gray mist.

The Keeper pointed dramatically. “There!”

Mira squinted. “I don’t see anything.”

“Precisely! The Delay is invisible whenever one is looking for it, and obvious whenever one is busy.”

“That seems unfair.”

“It is practically the definition,” said the Keeper.

He began rummaging through his pockets, producing in rapid succession a spoon, a map, three chalks, a teacup, a folded ladder, a walnut, and finally a spool of red thread.

“Take this.”

Mira accepted the spool. “What do I do with it?”

“Thread follows what resists,” said the Keeper. “Tie one end here—no, not there, that’s Thursday—there! To the winding key. Then walk through the house. Wherever the thread snags, the Delay has passed.”

Mira tied the thread as instructed. It shivered in her fingers as if alive.

“And if I find it?”

The Keeper looked grave. “Do not chase. Do not shout. Do not promise it anything.”

“What should I do then?”

“Ask it a question it cannot answer.”

Mira blinked. “Like the door?”

“Much more difficult than the door,” he said. “Doors are mostly hinges. Delays are excuses.”

Before she could ask another thing, the Keeper had opened a side door and nudged her into a narrow passage.

The clock-house inside was larger than the clock-house outside, which did not surprise Mira as much as it ought to have. The passage bent and split and crossed itself like a thought half-remembered. Rooms opened off it at odd angles.

The first room was a kitchen where kettles steamed in perfect silence. The second was full of calendars hanging from clotheslines, fluttering though there was no wind. The third contained nothing at all but a chair and a sign reading:

SIT HERE IF NECESSARY

Mira did not sit, because nothing is more suspicious than instructions that sound reasonable.

All the while she held the red thread, letting it spool out behind her. At first it hung straight and easy. Then, in a room full of ticking drawers (each drawer slightly ajar, each one breathing dust), it twitched.

Mira stopped.

The thread pulled to the left.

There was no door on the left, only a wallpapered wall patterned with tiny silver keys. She pressed it with one finger.

It sighed and opened.

Beyond was a staircase winding upward this time, so narrow she had to go sideways. The walls were lined with framed portraits of people asleep in chairs, on stairs, in gardens, standing up, mid-conversation, all looking so drowsy that Mira had to shake herself twice to keep from yawning.

At the top of the stairs was a round room under the clock face.

Here the sound of ticking was so loud it seemed to push at her chest. Great rods and wheels moved around the room like patient animals. In the very middle lay a mound of gray softness, exactly where the thread led.

It looked like a heap of dust cloaks, or a sleeping fog, or the shadow of something that had wandered away.

As Mira watched, it shifted.

Two pale eyes opened in the gray.

“Oh,” said the Delay, in a voice so slow it almost did not arrive. “Someone.”

Mira’s knees wished to tremble, but she sat them down firmly and held the spool tighter.

“Yes,” she said. “Someone.”

The Delay yawned, and the yawn took a long time. “You should come back later.”

“I’m here now.”

“That’s a pity.” It put its head—if it had a head—down on what might have been its paws. “Now is always crowded.”

Mira thought of the Keeper, of the clock-hands jerking, of the Minutes with their solemn rakes.

“You’re making the garden stop.”

“I’m resting,” said the Delay.

“In the Main Spring.”

“Comfortable,” it murmured.

Mira took a step closer. The gray around it spread a little, like spilled milk moving uphill.

“Will you leave, please?”

“Soon.”

“When soon?”

The Delay was silent so long that Mira wondered if it had gone back to sleep. Then it said, “Soon after a while. Or perhaps before it. Hard to say.”

That, she thought, sounded exactly like excuses.

She remembered the Keeper’s instructions: Ask it a question it cannot answer.

The difficulty was that she herself could not think of any question at all. Her mind filled with the wrong sort: Why are you here? Will you go? What are you? All of them seemed too easy, and the Delay would only answer “later” or “perhaps” and sink deeper into the gears.

The ticking boomed around her. One rod shuddered. A gear skipped a tooth with a metallic clack.

The Delay’s gray edges were spreading further.

Mira’s hand went into her pocket and found, by accident, her biscuit.

She drew it out.

The Delay lifted its eyes. “Is that for me?”

“No,” said Mira. “It’s for thinking.”

And before she could stop herself, she broke the biscuit in half.

At once she frowned.

The two halves were not equal.

One was a little bigger, and the broken edge of the other made a shape like a crooked moon.

Mira stared at them.

Then she looked around the room—at the wheels, the rods, the pendulum passing and returning, passing and returning.

Everything in clocks, she thought, was about equal pieces. Equal swings. Equal ticks. Equal turns.

The Delay shifted lazily. “You may as well sit down. I am very good at waiting.”

“That is the one thing I know,” said Mira.

A question it cannot answer.

She looked straight at the pale eyes in the gray and said, very clearly:

“If you are a Delay, when exactly are you?”

The ticking seemed to stop.

Not the clocks—those still moved—but the air itself paused to listen.

The Delay lifted its head. “I am...”

It hesitated.

The gray around it wrinkled.

“I am before—” it began.

“But before what?” said Mira quickly.

“Before after.”

“That’s not exact.”

“Then during... no—between...” The Delay’s edges shivered. “I am when things are not yet.”

“But you are here now,” said Mira, pressing on, for she felt something in the room begin to change. “If you are now, you are not delay. If you are later, you aren’t here. Which is it?”

The Delay made a low, unhappy sound, like a drawer sticking.

“I am... I am...”

Its gray form thinned at the corners.

Mira took another step. “What time are you?”

The pale eyes widened.

There was a sharp metallic snap beneath her feet as a gear caught properly for the first time. One rod straightened. The pendulum swung farther.

The Delay tried to gather itself, but the gray mist slid through its own shape.

“I do not keep time,” it whispered.

“Then you don’t belong in a clock,” said Mira.

At that, the whole room gave a ringing shake.

The great hands behind the clock face lurched forward together with a sound like a bell clearing its throat. Wind rushed through the gears. The red thread in Mira’s hand tightened, glowed hot for an instant, and then went slack.

The Delay gave one long sigh, not angry, only tired.

“Too specific,” it said, and blew apart into a puff of silver dust.

The dust whirled upward into the rafters and vanished between the numbers.
